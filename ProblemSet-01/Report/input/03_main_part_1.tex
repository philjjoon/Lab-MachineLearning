\section{Problems}
    



%DELETEME: In this chapter you start addressing your actual problem. Therefore, it makes often sense to make a detailed problem analysis first (if not done in introduction). You should be sure about what to do and how. As writtin in the background part, it might also make sense to include complex background information or papers you are basing on in this analysis. If you are solving a software problem, you should follow the state of the art of software development which basically includes: problem analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Maintenance is often also described but I believe this will not be required for most theses. Code should be placed in the appendix unless it is solving an essential aspect of your work.
